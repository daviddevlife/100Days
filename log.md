##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Finished my lab assignment for intermediate java programming, merge sort

**Thoughts:** I struggled with debugging the algorithm for merge sort, but I understand the logic behind it now. 

### Day 2: Oct 26 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have designed a GUI for my programming assignment, only partially complete, with Javafx.

**Thoughts** I utilized a queue for my app. Throwing in GUIs to the mix adds in the difficulty, but I enjoy spending some time working on it.
